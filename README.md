# The_Hotel_Booking_App_MySql
It was a project that I did for my school assignment. It is just an app where you can check in and check out of the hotel yourself without the need of the staff. It doesn't have any real use but yeah I wanted to create something. It uses MySql to store data. The main window contains the code for drawing the main window and is the main file that runs the whole code. The login is used to create the login page so that only authorized people can see the whole data.

I want to add some other features like the rooms list with pictures and their prices so that its easier to book a room. I am currently learning tkinter module so that I can do it
